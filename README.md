# Two Methods of Database Design

This repository is for demonstrating the largest academic project that I've completed to date. The projects consist of two different methods of approaching database design. After designing the database we implemented and entered all the data into a database with MySQL. 

[This presentation](./assignment_2_presentation.pdf) provides a general overview of the design and implementation steps taken for the Universal Relation Method. 

## The Full Reports

We had to capture *all* the data from the article excerpts found after the description found in [Assignment Description and Articles](assignment_2_description.pdf) to design a relationation database.
